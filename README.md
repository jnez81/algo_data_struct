### Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact
This artifact was designed to function as a stock market securities information reporting service.  The reporting service utilizes a RESTful API web-based protocol to retrieve specified company data in conjunction with a MongoDB database of company stocks information.

### Enhancements
The artifact was previously designed to retrieve a list of companies that that have the highest number of totals shares outstanding and then group the companies by their respective industry. It was later decided that this artifact could be significantly improved if it could provide potential investors with one of the most important values in respect to stocks, which is 'market capitalization.' The function will be significantly more efficient as it will only need to search for one specified company name and then determine the companyâ€™s respective market capitalization, or market cap.
